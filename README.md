# 🚀 Who's Up There?

A real-time space tracking application that displays the current location of the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts currently in space, and the current moon phase.

Built for **Code the Dream - Intro to Programming (Luna Class)** as a project to learn APIs, async/await, and DOM manipulation.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **ISS Location Tracking**: View the real-time latitude and longitude of the International Space Station
- **Astronaut Counter**: See how many people are currently in space and their names
- **Moon Phase Tracker**: Display the current moon phase and illumination percentage
- **Live Updates**: Fresh data fetched with each navigation click
- **Navigation**: Toggle between two views - "ISS & Crew" and "Moon Phase"

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure and content
- **CSS3** - Styling and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Async/await, Fetch API, DOM manipulation
- **Google Fonts** - Orbitron font for space-themed typography

---

## 🌐 APIs Used

1. **Open-Notify ISS Location API**  
   `http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json`  
   Provides real-time ISS coordinates

2. **Open-Notify Astronauts API**  
   `http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json`  
   Provides list of people currently in space

3. **Astronomical Applications Department**  
   `https://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/api`  
   Provides moon phase and astronomical data

   **Note:**
   CORS Proxy needed if APIs don't support HTTPS, if deploying:
   `https://corsproxy.io/?`

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This project demonstrates:

- ✅ Making asynchronous API requests using `fetch()`
- ✅ Using `async/await` syntax for cleaner asynchronous code
- ✅ Handling errors with `try-catch` blocks
- ✅ Manipulating the DOM to display API data
- ✅ Creating navigation between different data views
- ✅ Working with multiple API endpoints
- ✅ Implementing responsive design principles

---

## 🎨 Design

The application features a **Mission Control Dashboard** aesthetic with:

- Deep space black background (#0a0e27)
- Electric blue accents (#00d9ff)
- Orbitron font for futuristic typography
- Pulsing "LIVE" indicator
- Card-based layout with glassmorphism effects
